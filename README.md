## About

This game challenges players to test their luck and intuition. Each wrong selection deducts a life, and the game ends when lives hit zero. Users can choose the game type and reset the game whenever desired.

- Three Unique Options: Players have three distinct choices to make.
- Luck Mode: In Luck Mode, there's a thrilling 66% chance to select the correct option, testing both luck and intuition.
- Lives System: Players start with three lives; an incorrect selection costs them a life. When lives reach zero, the game ends.
- Game Modes: Users can select between different game modes and reset the game at their convenience.
- Original Assets: All images and animations are created using After Effects and exported as sequences.
- Sound and Music: Immersive sound effects and background music enhance the gaming atmosphere.
